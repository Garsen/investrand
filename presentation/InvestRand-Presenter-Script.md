# InvestRand Due Diligence Presentation
## Presenter's Script & Speaker Notes

**For:** Chand (Ampersand Insights)
**Audience:** Ezra Rasethe (InvestRand Founder)
**Duration:** 45-60 minutes (including discussion)

---

## PART 1: BRIEFING FOR CHAND

### Context

Ezra Rasethe is the founder of InvestRand, a property investment sourcing platform that has facilitated over R600M in investment opportunities over three years. He's a successful entrepreneur who has built a profitable, bootstrapped business.

Ezra engaged Develutions to rebuild his platform. He then came to us with concerns:
- Is the full code migration technically sound and necessary?
- Is the pricing reasonable relative to scope?
- Can we help him evaluate the situation?

He also mentioned the possibility of a fractional ownership arrangement — making us partners in InvestRand's growth rather than just vendors.

### Your Objectives for This Meeting

1. **Demonstrate understanding** — Show Ezra you truly grasp his business, his market, and his growth potential
2. **Present findings objectively** — Share what you found about Develutions without being adversarial
3. **Position the partnership** — Frame Ampersand as a partner invested in his success, not just a replacement vendor
4. **Secure agreement to proceed** — Get Ezra to agree to the partnership structure

### Tone and Approach

**Be consultative, not salesy.** You're a trusted advisor presenting findings, not a vendor pitching services.

- **Confident but not arrogant** — You know your stuff, but you're here to help, not lecture
- **Direct but respectful** — Don't hedge or waffle, but don't attack Develutions personally
- **Curious and collaborative** — Ask questions, invite his perspective, make it a conversation
- **Focused on HIM** — This is about Ezra's success, not about Ampersand's capabilities

**Key phrases to use:**
- "What we found..."
- "The evidence suggests..."
- "This raises a question worth exploring..."
- "What's your sense of...?"
- "Here's what the numbers tell us..."

**Phrases to avoid:**
- "We think Develutions is wrong..."
- "You should definitely..."
- "Trust us, we know better..."
- "This is a disaster..."

## PART 2: OPENING (Before You Show Any Slides)

### Setting the Stage

Before you even show the first slide, you need to establish the frame. This is crucial. Take 2-3 minutes to set context.

### What to Say

> "Ezra, thanks for making the time today. Before I get into the slides, let me tell you how I approached this.
>
> When we first spoke, you asked me three questions: Is this migration technically sound? Is the pricing reasonable? And can we help you make sense of it all?
>
> I took those questions seriously. I went through the Develutions documentation, looked at the technical approach, researched your market, and — most importantly — I tried to understand your business. Not just the technology, but what InvestRand actually does and where you're trying to take it.
>
> What I'm going to share today is what I found. Some of it validates what Develutions is doing. Some of it raises questions. And some of it points to opportunities I don't think anyone has fully explored yet.
>
> At the end, I'll share how I think we can work together — not as a vendor replacing another vendor, but as a partner who's invested in your success.
>
> Does that framing work for you? Any questions before we dive in?"

### Why This Works

- **Shows you listened** — You're addressing his original questions
- **Sets expectations** — He knows you'll be balanced, not just critical
- **Establishes authority** — You did the work, you understand the business
- **Opens the door to partnership** — You've planted the seed early
- **Invites collaboration** — You're checking in, not just presenting at him

---

## PART 3: SLIDE-BY-SLIDE SCRIPT

---

### SLIDE 1: Title Slide

**Purpose:** Establish the professional context

**What to Say:**

> "This is a technical due diligence review — an independent assessment of where things stand with the platform and the development approach. Let's get into it."

**Transition:** Move quickly. Don't linger on the title slide.

---

### SLIDE 2: Executive Summary

**Purpose:** This is the hook. Show Ezra the growth potential immediately.

**Key Points to Hit:**
- Current state: R600M facilitated, ~R2M/year in revenue
- Growth path: R1B → R6M/year, R2B → R12M+/year
- The opportunity: R170k/month → R1M+/month
- Core finding: Current rebuild doesn't address business functions needed for growth
- The four key findings (infrastructure over business, revenue functions missing, migration risk, regulatory attention)

**What to Say:**

> "Let me start with the bottom line.
>
> You've built something impressive. R600M in investment opportunities facilitated in three years, a profitable business, strong repeat customer rate. That's real.
>
> But here's what I want you to see: the growth potential.
>
> Right now, you're doing about R2 million a year. If you scale to R1 billion facilitated with improved conversion — which better technology should enable — you're looking at R6 million a year. At R2 billion, that's R12 million plus. We're talking about going from R170k a month to over R1 million a month.
>
> That's the prize. That's what we should be building towards.
>
> Now, here's the challenge: **the current rebuild doesn't address the business functions needed to get there.**
>
> Infrastructure is progressing — frontend is 80%, backend is 75%. But the things that actually drive revenue? Financials at 35%, CRM at 0%. Lead capture, deal facilitation, fee collection — out of scope.
>
> We also found some additional gaps: a sequencing problem in how the build is structured, no demo process to give you visibility, and no mobile strategy for your core demographic.
>
> I'll walk you through all of this. But the core message is: **there's a significant opportunity here, and we need to make sure the technology roadmap is aligned to capture it.**"

**Transition:**

> "Before I get into the details, let me tell you who we are and why we're qualified to help you."

---

### SLIDE 3: Why We Exist

**Purpose:** Establish Ampersand's origin, values, and approach

**Key Points to Hit:**
- What we saw: deteriorating trust, overpromise/underdeliver, impersonal transactions
- What we do differently: trust and transparency, deliver beyond expectations, partnership not transaction
- Client feedback: "You make our lives easier", "We enjoy working with you", "You deliver what you promise"
- Tagline: "Built on trust. Proven through delivery."

**What to Say:**

> "We started Ampersand because we'd seen too many technology relationships go wrong.
>
> Deteriorating trust. Vendors who overpromise and underdeliver — junior developers learning on client projects, timelines that slip without warning. Relationships that feel impersonal and transactional — vendors who disappear the moment the contract is signed.
>
> We do things differently.
>
> We build relationships on trust and transparency — honest communication, even when the news is hard. We deliver beyond expectations — senior professionals on every engagement, no exceptions. And we treat every engagement as a partnership, not a transaction. We care about your outcome, not just our invoice.
>
> Our clients tell us three things: 'You make our lives easier.' 'We enjoy working with you.' 'You deliver what you promise.'
>
> That's what we're about. Built on trust. Proven through delivery."

**Transition:**

> "We have three service lines, all under one brand."

---

### SLIDE 4: Three Service Lines

**Purpose:** Show Ampersand's capabilities and structure

**Key Points to Hit:**
- Technology Partnerships: Build products, embed teams, technical advisory, fractional CTO
- Infrastructure Services: VMware, Rubrik/Veeam, cloud architecture
- Technical Advisory: Due diligence, architecture reviews, CTO services
- Shared: Senior-only teams, delivery standards

**What to Say:**

> "Ampersand has three service lines.
>
> **Technology Partnerships** — we build digital products, embed experienced teams, and provide technical advisory services. This is where InvestRand fits.
>
> **Infrastructure Services** — for clients who need VMware consulting, data protection, cloud architecture.
>
> **Technical Advisory** — due diligence for investors, architecture reviews, fractional CTO services. This is actually how we started with you — assessing your situation.
>
> What's consistent across all three: senior-only teams. We don't have juniors learning on your project. You get experienced professionals from day one."

**Transition:**

> "Now let me show you our track record — why we're qualified to deliver for you."

---

### SLIDE 5: Track Record — Why We're the Right Partner

**Purpose:** Establish credibility through concrete delivery evidence

**Key Points to Hit:**
- Four industry verticals: Financial Services & Fintech, HR & Workforce Management, Enterprise Software & SaaS, Media & High-Scale Platforms
- Business stage coverage: Startups, Growth, Enterprise
- Stats: 100M+ users, 190+ markets, 200+ organisations, EU & SA reach

**What to Say:**

> "We've delivered across industries that are relevant to what you're building.
>
> **Financial Services and Fintech** — core banking platforms, regulatory compliance for SARB, POPIA, FICA, NCR. Directly relevant to any future regulatory requirements you might face.
>
> **HR and Workforce Management** — we manage platforms for European HR SaaS companies serving enterprise clients like Amazon.
>
> **Enterprise Software** — multi-tenant SaaS systems with 200+ organisations on a single platform.
>
> **Media and High-Scale Platforms** — content platforms reaching over 100 million users across 190+ markets globally.
>
> More importantly, we work across business stages. Startups, growth companies like yours, and enterprise. InvestRand sits in our sweet spot: a growth-stage business that needs both technical delivery and strategic guidance."

**Note on Stats:** If Ezra asks:
- **100M+ users** — OneFootball, a global sports content platform
- **190+ markets** — OneFootball operates in 190+ countries
- **200+ organisations** — DCX Cloud, a multi-tenant SaaS platform

**Transition:**

> "Now that you know who we are, let me walk you through the work we did to understand your situation."

---

### SLIDE 6: Scope & Approach

**Purpose:** Establish credibility — show the rigour of your process

**Key Points to Hit:**
- The three questions Ezra asked
- The review activities (document analysis, research, assessment)

**What to Say:**

> "You asked three questions: Is the migration technically sound and necessary? Is the pricing reasonable? Can we create a standardised brief to compare vendors?
>
> To answer these, we did a thorough document review — the Develutions proposal, their progress updates, the email correspondence. We also did independent research on your market, your business model, and industry benchmarks.
>
> What I'm presenting today is based on evidence, not opinion. Where we're making inferences, I'll tell you. Where we have hard data, I'll show you the source."

**Transition:**

> "Before we get into the technical findings, I want to show you that we understand your world — the market you're operating in and the business you've built."

---

### SLIDE 7: Industry Context

**Purpose:** Demonstrate market understanding and validate the opportunity

**Key Points to Hit:**
- R27B commercial property deals in SA (2024), up 34%
- $10B+ PropTech market
- 10.75% prime rate (declining — good for property investment)
- 11.9% global PropTech CAGR

**What to Say:**

> "Let's talk about your market.
>
> South African commercial property saw R27 billion in deals last year — up 34% from 2023. The PropTech market here is over $10 billion and growing. Interest rates are coming down — the prime rate has dropped four times consecutively. That's good news for property investment.
>
> Globally, PropTech is growing at almost 12% annually. This is a rising tide.
>
> The point is: **you're in the right market at the right time.** The question is whether your technology platform is positioned to capture that growth."

**Transition:**

> "Now let me show you that I understand how your business actually works."

---

### SLIDE 8: Business Model

**Purpose:** Show deep understanding of InvestRand's model

**Key Points to Hit:**
- R600M facilitated (from ezrarasethe.com)
- Key metrics: 1,000+ users, 60% repeat, median age 33, ~R2M year 2 revenue
- 5% fee model (min R30k per deal)
- Key distinction: property sourcing marketplace, NOT fractional investment
- Full property ownership, no pooled funds

**What to Say:**

> "Let me make sure I've got this right, because it's important.
>
> InvestRand is a **property sourcing marketplace**. You're not a fractional investment platform like EasyProperties. Your customers buy whole properties. You source the opportunities, vet them, and charge a 5% fee — minimum R30k — when a deal closes.
>
> That's a fundamentally different business. Higher ticket size, deeper customer relationship, more support needed per deal. But also higher revenue per transaction.
>
> You've got over 1,000 users, 60% of them are repeat customers — which is a strong signal — and your median customer is 33 years old. That demographic detail matters, and I'll come back to it.
>
> You're profitable. You're bootstrapped. You've built something real without outside money. That's not common."

**Pause here. Check in:**

> "Does that match your understanding of the business? Anything I'm missing?"

**Transition:**

> "Now let's look at how the revenue model actually works in practice, because there's an important insight here."

---

### SLIDE 9: Unit Economics

**Purpose:** Explain the conversion rate insight — facilitated ≠ transacted

**Key Points to Hit:**
- R600M facilitated × 5% = R30M expected... but ~R3M actual revenue
- This implies ~10% conversion rate
- Not a problem — it's how the model works
- Key metric: conversion rate is the lever to pull

**What to Say:**

> "Here's something interesting that took me a minute to figure out.
>
> If you've facilitated R600 million at a 5% fee, you'd expect R30 million in revenue. But the reported revenue is around R3 million over two years. So what's going on?
>
> The answer is that **facilitated doesn't mean transacted**. You're showing customers R600 million worth of opportunities. About 10% of those convert to actual deals where you collect a fee.
>
> That's not a problem — that's just how a sourcing marketplace works. It's actually a reasonable conversion rate.
>
> But here's the insight: **conversion rate is your growth lever.** If you can improve conversion from 10% to 15% or 20% through better user experience, faster deal flow, mobile access — your revenue grows significantly without needing to source more properties."

**Transition:**

> "Let me show you what that growth looks like in practice — what YOU stand to make as the business scales."

---

### SLIDE 10: Growth Projections

**Purpose:** Show Ezra his personal upside — this is HIS money

**Key Points to Hit:**
- Current: ~R2M/year (R170k/month)
- At R1B / 10% conversion: R3.8M/year (R320k/month)
- At R1B / 15% conversion: R6.1M/year (R510k/month)
- At R2B / 15% conversion: R12M+/year (R1M+/month)
- Monthly cash flow breakdown

**What to Say:**

> "I want to show you what this means for you personally.
>
> Right now, after operating costs, you're taking home around R170k a month. That's solid.
>
> At R1 billion facilitated with the current 10% conversion, that goes to R320k a month. If we can improve conversion to 15% through better technology and user experience, you're at R510k a month.
>
> At R2 billion facilitated? You're looking at over R1 million a month.
>
> This isn't hypothetical. These are the numbers based on your actual fee structure and cost base.
>
> **The question is: what does it take to get there?** And that's where we need to look at what Develutions is building — and what they're not building."

**Transition:**

> "Now let me shift gears and walk you through our assessment of the current development situation."

---

### SLIDE 11: Why Business Understanding Comes First

**Purpose:** Set up the assessment with industry context on why this matters

**Key Points to Hit:**
- 16% of IT projects delivered on time, on budget, with full scope
- 31% of software projects cancelled before completion
- 52% more likely to succeed with clear requirements
- Root cause: poor business understanding, not technical complexity

**What to Say:**

> "Before I get into the specifics, I want to share some context that I think is important.
>
> Industry data shows that only 16% of IT projects are delivered on time, on budget, with the full scope. A third are cancelled entirely. The number one reason isn't technical complexity — it's **poor requirements gathering and business understanding**.
>
> Projects that start with clear business requirements are 52% more likely to succeed.
>
> Why does this matter? Because as I reviewed the Develutions documentation, I noticed a pattern: lots of technical progress, but less clarity on how the technology maps to your business processes and revenue functions.
>
> Let me show you what I mean."

**Transition:**

> "I'm going to use a simple analogy to explain what their progress numbers actually mean."

---

### SLIDE 12: Infrastructure Explainer (Building Analogy)

**Purpose:** Make the abstract concrete — help Ezra understand "progress"

**Key Points to Hit:**
- Foundation & Plumbing = Backend infrastructure (75%)
- Storefront = Frontend/UI (80%)
- Stock & Inventory = Business logic (35%)
- Cash Register = Revenue functions (0%)
- You can have a beautiful building with nothing to sell

**What to Say:**

> "Think of it like building a retail store.
>
> The foundation and plumbing — that's the backend infrastructure. Develutions has that at 75%. Good progress.
>
> The storefront — that's the frontend, the UI. They're at 80%. Looking good.
>
> But the stock and inventory — the business logic, the actual functionality that makes the store work — that's at 35%.
>
> And the cash register — the revenue functions, how you actually collect money — that's at 0%. It's out of scope.
>
> **You can have a beautiful building with no stock to sell and no way to collect payment.**
>
> That's what concerns me about the current trajectory."

**Transition:**

> "Let me show you how this maps to your actual business process."

---

### SLIDE 13: Business Process & Technology Coverage

**Purpose:** Show where technology supports the business — and where it doesn't

**Key Points to Hit:**
- The 7-step InvestRand process (Source → Qualify → Match → Educate → Facilitate → Close → Support)
- Green/amber/red coverage indicators
- Critical gaps: CLOSE and SUPPORT stages have least coverage

**What to Say:**

> "This is your business process — how InvestRand actually works, from sourcing properties to supporting customers after they buy.
>
> The green areas are where technology coverage is strong. Amber is partial. Red is gaps.
>
> Notice where the gaps are: **CLOSE and SUPPORT**. The stages where you actually collect revenue and build the relationship that drives your 60% repeat rate.
>
> The technology rebuild is focused on the early stages — sourcing, listing, browsing. That's useful, but it's not where your growth is constrained."

**Transition:**

> "Now let me show you Develutions' own progress numbers, and a question they raise."

---

### SLIDE 14: Develutions Progress Assessment

**Purpose:** Present their self-reported progress objectively

**Key Points to Hit:**
- Their claimed 55-60% overall progress
- Breakdown: Frontend 80%, Backend 75%, Financials 35%, CRM 0%
- Based on their own emails and documentation

**What to Say:**

> "This is based on Develutions' own reporting — their December email specifically.
>
> They claim 55-60% overall progress. When you break it down: frontend 80%, backend 75%, financials 35%, CRM 0%.
>
> I'm not questioning their technical competence. The infrastructure work looks solid. But notice the pattern: **the highest progress is in infrastructure, the lowest is in business functionality.**
>
> That's the imbalance I'm flagging."

**Transition:**

> "And this raises a fundamental question about sequencing."

---

### SLIDE 15: The Sequencing Problem

**Purpose:** Challenge the approach without being adversarial

**Key Points to Hit:**
- How can frontend/backend be 75-80% if business logic is 35%?
- Infrastructure should follow business requirements, not precede them
- Risk: may need to rebuild infrastructure when business logic is defined

**What to Say:**

> "Here's a question that kept coming up as I reviewed this:
>
> How can the frontend and backend be 75-80% complete if the business logic is only 35% defined?
>
> In best practice, you define the business requirements first, then build the infrastructure to support them. If you build infrastructure before business logic, you risk having to rebuild when you finally define what the business actually needs.
>
> I'm not saying this has happened. But it's a risk worth understanding. **The highest-risk, highest-complexity work has been left for last.**"

**Transition:**

> "There are a few other gaps worth mentioning."

---

### SLIDE 16: Stakeholder Visibility Gap

**Purpose:** Flag the lack of demo/review process

**Key Points to Hit:**
- No documented demo or review process
- Best practice: bi-weekly demos of working software
- Risk: first time Ezra sees the system may be at handover

**What to Say:**

> "One thing I couldn't find in any of the documentation: a regular demo or review process.
>
> Industry best practice is bi-weekly demos of working software. It keeps the client involved, catches misalignments early, and builds confidence.
>
> I may have missed something, but I didn't see evidence of regular demos with you. **When was the last time you saw working software from Develutions?**"

**Pause for his answer. This is a genuine question.**

**Transition:**

> "There are also some technical gaps in DevOps and testing."

---

### SLIDE 17: DevOps & Testing Gaps

**Purpose:** Technical credibility — show you understand the stack

**Key Points to Hit:**
- What exists: Docker, Zappa, Vitest, Playwright, GitHub Actions (partial)
- Gaps: No TDD, unknown test coverage, incomplete CI/CD
- Not critical, but worth addressing

**What to Say:**

> "On the technical side, they've got some good foundations — Docker, testing frameworks, some CI/CD.
>
> But there are gaps: no test-driven development practice documented, unknown test coverage levels, incomplete deployment automation.
>
> This isn't a dealbreaker, but it's the kind of thing that creates risk at handover and ongoing maintenance."

**Transition:**

> "Now here's a gap that I think is more significant."

---

### SLIDE 18: Mobile Gap

**Purpose:** Flag the critical missing strategy

**Key Points to Hit:**
- Mobile not mentioned in ANY Develutions documentation
- Median customer age: 33
- SA smartphone penetration: 82.5%
- SA mobile banking: 82%
- Neither current nor proposed stack includes mobile

**What to Say:**

> "This one surprised me.
>
> Your median customer is 33 years old. South Africa has 82% smartphone penetration and 82% mobile banking adoption in that demographic. These are mobile-first users.
>
> I searched the Develutions documentation for any mention of mobile strategy. **Nothing.** Neither the current platform nor the proposed rebuild includes a mobile approach.
>
> That's a gap. Your competitors with mobile apps will have an advantage with your core demographic."

**Transition:**

> "There's also a regulatory dimension worth mentioning."

---

### SLIDE 19: Regulatory Considerations

**Purpose:** Flag without creating alarm

**Key Points to Hit:**
- Property sourcing may require PPRA registration
- If investment advice is given, FAIS may apply
- Not critical blockers, but need verification

**What to Say:**

> "I want to flag something, but I don't want to overstate it.
>
> Property sourcing businesses may need PPRA registration. If you're giving any kind of investment advice, FAIS comes into play.
>
> I'm not saying you're non-compliant — I don't have visibility into your legal setup. But it's worth verifying that the technology approach accounts for any regulatory requirements."

**Transition:**

> "So that's the assessment. Let me summarise what we recommend."

---

### SLIDE 20: Recommendations

**Purpose:** Clear, actionable next steps

**Key Points to Hit:**
- Verify progress (request code access or live demo)
- Confirm regulatory status
- Define growth targets
- Align technology to business scaling

**What to Say:**

> "Based on everything I've shared, here are my recommendations.
>
> First, **verify progress**. Request code access or a live demonstration from Develutions to validate the claimed 55-60% completion.
>
> Second, **confirm regulatory status**. Make sure you're covered on PPRA and FAIS.
>
> Third, **define your growth targets**. What does success look like? R1 billion facilitated? R2 billion? This should drive the technology roadmap.
>
> Fourth, and most importantly: **align the technology to business scaling, not just infrastructure modernisation.** The rebuild should enable revenue growth, not just update the tech stack."

**Transition:**

> "Now let me talk about how we can work together to make this happen."

---

### SLIDE 21: Path Forward

**Purpose:** Present options without being pushy

**Key Points to Hit:**
- Option 1: Continue with Develutions (with enhanced oversight)
- Option 2: Pause and reassess
- Option 3: Transition to Ampersand

**What to Say:**

> "You have options here.
>
> You could continue with Develutions, but with enhanced oversight — regular demos, clearer milestones, better alignment to business requirements.
>
> You could pause and reassess — take stock before committing more resources.
>
> Or you could transition to a partner who takes full responsibility for the technology ecosystem — that's where we come in.
>
> Let me explain what that partnership would look like."

**Transition:**

> "First, I want to make a point about what it takes to succeed."

---

### SLIDE 22: GTM Equation

**Purpose:** Position technology as one component — show business maturity

**Key Points to Hit:**
- Success = Property Sourcing + Regulatory + Go-to-Market + Technology + Operations
- Technology is necessary but not sufficient
- This is about enabling your growth, not just building software

**What to Say:**

> "Here's something important.
>
> Technology is one component of your success. It's necessary, but not sufficient.
>
> You still need property sourcing capability — that's your core competence. You need regulatory compliance. You need go-to-market and sales. You need operations.
>
> We can own the technology piece. But we succeed when YOU succeed across all these dimensions. That's why I'm interested in a partnership, not just a project."

**Transition:**

> "Now let me show you how we'd work together."

---

### SLIDE 23: Engagement Model

**Purpose:** Show the working relationship

**Key Points to Hit:**
- Chand as partner and engagement lead — direct relationship with Ezra
- Specialists brought in as needed
- Full ecosystem delivery: code, infrastructure, DevOps, mobile strategy

**What to Say:**

> "If we work together, here's how it would work.
>
> You deal with me directly. I'm your partner and engagement lead — strategy, oversight, and day-to-day delivery. One throat to choke, one person accountable.
>
> I bring in specialists as needed — DevOps, security, mobile — but you're not managing a team. You're managing a relationship with me.
>
> We deliver the full ecosystem: code, infrastructure, DevOps, and a mobile strategy that actually addresses your customer demographic."

**Transition:**

> "Let me show you the commercial structure."

---

### SLIDE 24: The Proposal

**Purpose:** Present the deal — fees, structure, what Ezra said

**Key Points to Hit:**
- Ezra's offer: fractional ownership as we grow together
- Ampersand's ask: Replace Develutions — full responsibility
- The equation: Fractional Ownership + Discounted Rate = Partnership

**What to Say:**

> "When we spoke, you said something that stuck with me: 'You sort of become fractional owner of the product as we grow.'
>
> I took that seriously. Here's what I'm proposing:
>
> We **replace Develutions** — not absorb them, replace them. Ampersand takes full responsibility for the technology ecosystem. The code, the infrastructure, the delivery, the ongoing support. It's ours to own.
>
> In return, we work on a partnership basis. A base retainer, revenue participation that grows as you grow, and a meaningful success bonus at R1 billion facilitated.
>
> The equation is simple: **your fractional ownership offer plus our discounted rate equals a true partnership.** We both have skin in the game. We both win when InvestRand wins."

**Transition:**

> "But I want to be transparent about what that means for both of us."

---

### SLIDE 25: Partnership Obligations

**Purpose:** Show maturity — acknowledge mutual dependencies

**Key Points to Hit:**
- Ampersand delivers: platform, infrastructure, mobile strategy
- Ampersand's skin in game: discounted rate
- Ezra delivers: go-to-market, marketing, sales
- Ezra's skin in game: payment + ownership commitment
- The dependency: if Ezra doesn't execute on go-to-market, our ownership is worthless

**What to Say:**

> "I want to be upfront about something.
>
> Fractional ownership creates mutual obligations. We both have to deliver.

> Our job is to build and maintain the platform — the technology, the infrastructure, the mobile strategy. Our skin in the game is the discounted rate. We're betting on your success.
>
> Your job is go-to-market — sourcing deals, marketing, sales, customer relationships. That's your core competence, and it's not something we can do for you.
>
> Here's the reality: **if you don't execute on go-to-market, our fractional ownership is worthless.** We're dependent on you. That's why this is a partnership, not a transaction.

> I'm comfortable with that dependency because I've seen what you've built. You've got a track record."

**Transition:**

> "Let me close by showing you what success looks like."

### SLIDE 26: What Success Looks Like

**Purpose:** Paint the picture — make it tangible

**Key Points to Hit:**
- Short-term (90 days): Working platform, verified business logic, handover complete
- Medium-term (12 months): Mobile-ready, CRM integrated, lead conversion working
- Long-term (24+ months): Scaled to growth targets, regulatory compliant, Ezra has peace of mind

**What to Say:**

> "Here's what we're building towards.
>
> In the first 90 days: a working platform with verified business logic. You've seen it, tested it, signed off on it. Clean handover.
>
> By 12 months: mobile-ready, CRM integrated, lead conversion actually working. The revenue functions are live.
>
> By 24 months and beyond: scaled to your growth targets, fully regulatory compliant, and — most importantly — **you have peace of mind.** You're not worrying about technology. You're focused on growing the business.
>
> That's what I want to deliver for you."

## PART 4: CLOSING THE CONVERSATION

### After the Last Slide

Don't rush to close. Let the presentation breathe. Then:

> "That's the presentation. Before I ask about next steps, what questions do you have? What's landing, and what needs more clarity?"

**Let him talk.** Listen. Take notes. Address his concerns.

### Handling Common Objections

**"What about the money I've already paid Develutions?"**

> "That's a sunk cost consideration. The question isn't what you've spent — it's what delivers the best outcome from here. If continuing with Develutions gets you to R1 billion, great. If transitioning to us gets you there faster and more reliably, the previous investment doesn't change that calculus."

**"How do I know you'll be any different?"**

> "Fair question. Three things: First, you'll have regular demos — bi-weekly minimum. You'll see working software, not just progress reports. Second, you have one point of accountability — me. Not a team to manage, not a project manager to chase. Third, our compensation is tied to your success. If you don't grow, our fractional ownership is worthless. We're aligned."

**"The fee structure seems complicated."**

> "Let me simplify it: base retainer to cover our costs, revenue participation so we grow as you grow, and a success bonus when you hit R1 billion. The base is fixed; everything else is upside that only kicks in when you're winning."

**"I need to think about it."**

> "Of course. What would help you make the decision? Is there additional information you need? A conversation with one of my technical specialists? A more detailed scope breakdown? Tell me what would move this forward for you."

### The Ask

When it feels right:

> "Ezra, here's what I'm asking.
>
> Give us the opportunity to be your technology partner. Not a vendor — a partner. We'll take full responsibility for the platform. We'll deliver the mobile strategy that Develutions hasn't addressed. We'll tie our compensation to your growth.
>
> I believe we can take InvestRand from R170k a month to R1 million a month. I want to be part of making that happen.
>
> What do you need to see to move forward?"

### Next Steps

Whatever he says, get a concrete next step:

- If yes: "Great. Let's schedule a working session to define the transition plan."
- If needs more info: "What specifically? I'll get it to you by [date]."
- If needs to think: "When would be a good time to reconnect? I'll send a summary of today's discussion."
- If no: "I respect that. The offer stands. If anything changes, you know where to find me."

- Arrive 5 minutes early

### During the Meeting
- **Slow down.** Let key points land.

- **Ask questions.** "Does that match your experience?" "What's your take on this?"
- **Pause for discussion.** Don't rush through all 26 slides without breathing.
- **Watch his body language.** If he's leaning back or checking his phone, you're losing him.

### After the Meeting
- Send a thank-you email within 24 hours
- Summarise the key points and agreed next steps
- Attach the presentation PDF
- Propose a specific date for the next conversation

## FINAL THOUGHT

This isn't a sales pitch. It's a partnership conversation.

Ezra has built something real. He's looking for someone he can trust to take care of the technology so he can focus on growing the business.

Your job is to demonstrate that you understand his world, you've done the work, and you're invested in his success — not just in winning a contract.

If you do that, the partnership will follow.

Good luck, Chand.
