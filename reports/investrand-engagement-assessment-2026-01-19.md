# InvestRand Engagement Assessment

**Date:** 19 January 2026
**Prepared by:** Ampersand Insights
**Status:** Internal Assessment — Engagement Withdrawal Recommendation

---

## Executive Summary

Following our technical due diligence and subsequent regulatory verification, Ampersand has identified material concerns that prevent us from proceeding with an engagement at this time. These concerns relate to regulatory compliance verification and business model clarity — matters that require resolution before any technology partnership can be responsibly undertaken.

This assessment is not a reflection on InvestRand's vision or potential. Rather, it reflects Ampersand's obligation to ensure that engagements we enter are structured for success, with clear foundations upon which to build.

---

## Background

Ampersand was approached to provide technology leadership support to InvestRand, a South African property investment platform. Initial discussions explored a fractional CTO arrangement to address challenges with the current technology delivery partner.

As part of our standard due diligence process, we conducted:
- External technical assessment of the platform
- Business model analysis based on available documentation
- Regulatory compliance verification via PPRA public records

---

## Findings

### 1. Regulatory Registration Status

We conducted a search of the Property Practitioners Regulatory Authority (PPRA) public register to verify registration status.

| Entity | PPRA Register Status |
|--------|---------------------|
| Ezra Rasethe (individual) | 2 entries found (status unverified) |
| InvestRand | Not found |
| Rasethe Property Group | Not found |
| Infinity Property Group | 4 entries found |

**Observation:** InvestRand, as the entity operating the platform and collecting the 5% sourcing fee on property transactions, does not appear in the PPRA register as a registered property practitioner agency.

The Property Practitioners Act 22 of 2019 requires that any person or entity earning commission on property transactions hold a valid Fidelity Fund Certificate. The distinction between a "sourcing fee" and "commission" may have legal nuance, but this requires professional legal clarification rather than assumption.

### 2. Business Model Clarity

Our analysis identified questions about how the technology platform supports the revenue model:

- The mechanism for deal facilitation (connecting investor to property) is not defined in the platform scope
- The process for collecting the 5% sourcing fee is not captured in the technology specification
- Core business functionality (CRM integration, lead capture) remains at 0-35% completion despite months of development

These are business definition questions, not technology problems. Technology leadership cannot be effective without clear answers to how the platform enables revenue generation.

### 3. Current Development Status

The existing development engagement has produced infrastructure work but limited progress on business-critical functionality:

| Component | Progress | Business Impact |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| Frontend/Backend infrastructure | 75-80% | Foundation only |
| Financial calculations | 35% | Core value proposition |
| CRM integration | 0% | Lead management |
| Deal facilitation | Out of scope | Revenue enablement |

A new technology leader inheriting this situation would face immediate challenges in delivering business value without first addressing the foundational questions above.

## Ampersand's Position

Ampersand's model is built on delivering measurable outcomes for clients. To do this effectively, we require:

1. **Clear regulatory standing** — We need confidence that the business operates within applicable regulatory frameworks
2. **Defined success criteria** — Technology leadership requires clarity on how technology enables the business model
3. **Viable engagement structure** — Our engagements are structured around delivery, not equity participation in early-stage ventures

At present, we do not have sufficient clarity on points 1 and 2 to proceed responsibly.

---

## Recommendation

We recommend pausing engagement discussions until the following matters are addressed:

### Required Clarifications

1. **Regulatory compliance verification**
   - Written confirmation of which registered entity collects the sourcing fee
   - Current Fidelity Fund Certificate status for that entity
   - Legal opinion on compliance with Property Practitioners Act (if operating under a different structure)

2. **Business model documentation**
   - End-to-end investor journey: from discovery to completed transaction
   - Revenue collection process: when and how the 5% fee is invoiced and collected
   - Role of technology in enabling (not just supporting) the business model

3. **Development strategy alignment**
   - Clear prioritisation of business-critical features over infrastructure
   - Defined scope that includes deal facilitation and revenue tracking

---

## Path Forward

Ampersand remains supportive of InvestRand's mission to broaden access to property investment in South Africa. Should the matters above be addressed, we would welcome the opportunity to revisit engagement discussions.

In the interim, we recommend InvestRand:

1. **Engage a compliance attorney** to review the business model against Property Practitioners Act and FAIS requirements
2. **Document the investor journey** from discovery through to transaction completion and fee collection
3. **Clarify the development roadmap** to ensure technology investment addresses business-critical gaps

We are happy to provide a referral to compliance specialists if that would be helpful.

---

## Conclusion

This decision reflects Ampersand's commitment to entering engagements where we can deliver genuine value. The concerns identified are addressable, and we hope InvestRand will take the steps necessary to establish the foundations for a successful technology partnership — whether with Ampersand or another provider.

We appreciate the openness and trust shown during our discussions and wish Ezra and the InvestRand team well as they work through these matters.
