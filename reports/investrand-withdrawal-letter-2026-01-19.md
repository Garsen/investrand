Dear Ezra,

Thank you for the time you've invested in exploring a potential partnership with Ampersand. We've genuinely enjoyed our conversations and have great respect for what you're building with InvestRand.

After careful consideration, we've concluded that Ampersand is not the right partner for InvestRand at this stage. I want to be open about our reasoning.

## Our Position

As part of our standard due diligence, we reviewed the PPRA public register and found that while you have personal registration and Infinity Property Group appears as a registered agency, InvestRand itself is not listed. Given that InvestRand operates a platform collecting fees on property transactions, we would need to see the regulatory compliance position fully documented before entering any engagement.

Additionally, the core business mechanics — how an investor moves from discovery to completed transaction, and how InvestRand captures revenue in that process — are not yet defined in a way that allows technology to be built against them. These are business definition questions that sit outside of what a technology partner can solve.

Ampersand's model is built around defined deliverables and measurable outcomes. Without clarity on the regulatory and business foundations, we're not in a position to structure an engagement that would serve you well.

## The Way Forward

Before engaging any technology partner, InvestRand needs to establish its regulatory and business foundations clearly. Once those are in place, you'll be in a much stronger position — not just for technology partnerships, but for the investor conversations you're working toward.

We wish you every success with InvestRand, Ezra.

Warm regards,

**Ampersand Insights**
