**Re:** Technology Partnership Discussions

Dear Ezra,

Thank you for the time you've invested in exploring a potential partnership with Ampersand. We've genuinely enjoyed our conversations and have great respect for what you're building with InvestRand — the mission to democratise property investment in South Africa is meaningful work, and your passion for it is clear.

After careful consideration, we've concluded that the timing isn't right for Ampersand to take on a technology leadership role with InvestRand. I want to explain our thinking openly, because we value the relationship and want to be helpful even as we step back.

## Why We're Stepping Back

Our due diligence process surfaced a few areas where we'd need greater clarity before committing resources. These aren't criticisms — they're simply foundations that need to be in place for any technology partner to succeed.

**Regulatory positioning**

As part of our standard process, we reviewed the PPRA public register. We found your personal registration and entries for Infinity Property Group, but didn't find InvestRand listed as a registered agency. Given that InvestRand collects a sourcing fee on property transactions, we'd want to understand the compliance structure before stepping into a leadership role. This may well be straightforward — perhaps the fee flows through a registered entity — but it's something that should be documented clearly.

**Business-to-technology alignment**

The technical work done to date has focused on infrastructure, but the core questions of how an investor moves from discovery to completed transaction — and how InvestRand captures revenue in that process — aren't yet reflected in the platform scope. A technology leader needs these answers to prioritise effectively. Without them, there's a risk of building beautifully engineered systems that don't move the business forward.

**Engagement structure**

Our model works best when there's a defined scope with measurable deliverables. The conversation has moved toward equity participation and fractional ownership, which isn't how we typically structure engagements. That's not a judgement on the opportunity — it's simply a mismatch with how Ampersand operates.

## What We'd Suggest

Before bringing on any technology leadership — whether Ampersand or someone else — it would be worth addressing:

1. **A short conversation with a compliance attorney** to confirm InvestRand's regulatory position is solid. This protects you, your investors, and any partners you bring on board.

2. **A clear map of the investor journey** from "I see this property" through to "I own it and InvestRand has been paid." This becomes the blueprint for what technology needs to do.

3. **A frank conversation with Develutions** about whether the current rebuild is addressing the right problems. Infrastructure is important, but if CRM integration and financial calculations aren't prioritised, the new platform may have the same gaps as the current one.

## The Door Remains Open

We're not disappearing. If you work through the items above and would like to revisit the conversation, we'd be glad to hear from you. We can also recommend compliance professionals if that would be useful — just say the word.

InvestRand has real potential, and you've built something meaningful from scratch. The challenges you're facing are normal for a business at this stage. Sorting them out will put you in a much stronger position — not just for technology partnerships, but for the investor conversations you've been navigating.

We wish you every success, Ezra. Thank you for considering Ampersand.

Warm regards,

**Ampersand Insights**
